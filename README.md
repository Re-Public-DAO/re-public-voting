# Re-Public Voting

This is a voting platform that uses delegation by topic for better decision making. You can read more about it here:

The code now lives in a private Gitlab repo as we get a working prototype built. It will soon be released under the MIT license.

To get a demo and invitation to the prototype, email voting@re-public.io.
